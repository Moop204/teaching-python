# Operations

Operations are like actions you can do to information. At a high level like with files you can read, write, delete and append a file. 

For programming languages we tend to split operations from functions even though they can be defined in similar ways. Operations have an `operator` (e.g. '+', '-') which is the symbol that applies the action.
